# Prize & Promotions

Welcome to the <b>Prize Promotions for Small Business Web Application</b>. 

IÂ´m a System Analysis and Development student at <a  href="https://claretiano.edu.br/"> Claretiano</a> Brazilian-based International University.

The aim is to develop a free web application to help small enterprises to manage prizes and rewards in successful promotions in their business. 

For a better understanding, please have a look at either the attached [System Overview Documentation file](https://github.com/Paulo-AndradeB/Prize-Promotions/wiki/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW-DOCUMENTATION), and the [Use Cases](https://github.com/Paulo-AndradeB/Prize-Promotions/blob/Develop/analysis-design/Use%20Cases%20-%20Prize%20Promotions.docx) file, both of them wrote in pt-br. 

We are working mostly with <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, MySql, Python, Figma, Astah, and UML</b>.
